A minimal STM32 bare-metal project built entirely from scratch without STM32CubeMX, HAL, or LL libraries.
This project uses manually copied CMSIS core files and custom header definitions to access STM32 peripherals directly through memory-mapped registers.
It demonstrates how to bring up an STM32 microcontroller with the lowest-level setup, focusing on understanding how the hardware works internally.

Target MCU
STM32F0 Series
STM32F070RB

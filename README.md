# stm32-cmsis-gpio-blink
This project demonstrates how to control an STM32 GPIO peripheral using direct register-level programming without relying on HAL or LL libraries. 
It uses CMSIS-style struct mappings to access memory-mapped peripheral registers, providing a clear understanding of how GPIO hardware works internally on STM32 microcontrollers.
